Title: Why should you create your own bank? 
---

Bitcoin is a revolutionsing technology that enables individuals across the world, regardless of their background, to be in control of their money. This possibility removes the trust we are forced to give to bankers and governmental institutions or the person managing our funds. Bitcoin is true freedom money.

### How does the current banking system work?
When we first hear Bitcoiners saying "I am in control of my money", it is likely to sound ridiculous since many people in Western countries have direct access to their bank accounts. However, with the recent events of 2023, we realise that money that is sitting in your bank account can disapear or be taken away *very quickly*. 

What's more, 1.7 billion people do not have access to banks because of the political or social situations in their country. They are forced to trust someone else with their money.

Banks take advantage of the trust that they force individuals to give up. 

### Why would you become your own bank?
Across history, too many people have been hurt by the greediness of governments and banks. From the Roman Empire to current politics, the scenario has always been the same. These institutions are in control of the money supply or the issuance of money. They become greedy and increase the money supply which devalues the currency but enriches themselves in the short term, resulting in stealing the savings of hardworking people.

- If Robbie and Anna have 10 dollars each, they control 50% of the total money supply. If someone decides to print an additional 20 dollars. They control 25% of the total money supply. 

Bitcoin has a finite supply, which means that no one can print or issue more Bitcoin. If you have self-custody of 1 BTC, you will have 0.000005% of the total money supply. Forever. (unless you spend it of course).

### What are the risks of being your own bank?
Before you decide to become your own bank, you must realise the risks involved. 
You are responsible for your money and no one else. It means that if you lose access to your seed phrase (more on that later), there won't be customer service to call. There will be no refunds. If you are careless with your backup and someone finds it, you will likely loose your savings. **The consequences of your irresponsibility immediately impact you.**

Repeat: You are responsible, no one else.

### How do you create your own bank?
If you want to create your own bank, you need to have self-custody of your Bitcoin. Self-custody means that you do not trust someone else to hold your freedom money for you. If you leave your money on exchanges like Coinbase or in custodial wallets like Wallet of Satoshi, you are trusting someone else with your money. 

Bitcoin is an open source software, which means everyone can see how it works and anyone is free to copy it. Following this ethos, true Bitcoin companies are open source and I would encourage everyone to free and open source software and hardware to self-custody your Bitcoin.
