#### MISSION
This place aims at crystallising what I learn on my journey to sovereignty by exploring Bitcoin, FOSS tools, hardware and software.

In the attempt to learn more, I enumerate the facets of the Bitcoin and privacy rabbit holes. Both might seem technical and daunting, *at times, it is for me*, but keep climbing.

This journey doesn't start alone, as it follows the open and supportive communities in the space. I want to take this mission higher by working with a Bitcoin-centric company, and I will.
