#### MISSION
This place aims at crystallising what I learn on my journey to sovereignty by exploring Bitcoin, FOSS tools and tinkering with hardware and software.

I enumerate the countless facets of the Bitcoin and privacy rabbit holes by presenting each item in an approchable way. Both might seem technical and daunting (it surely was for me) but it doesn't have to be. 

This journey doesn't start alone. It is fueled by the open and supportive communities in the space. I want to take this mission higher by working with a Bitcoin centric company, and I will.

#### ABOUT
I am on a journey towards spirituality and sovereignty by tinkering with the world inside and around me. Honest, open and raw connections saved me and I am here to contribute back â€“ more about me.
