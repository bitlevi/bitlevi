#### MISSION
This place crystallises what I learn on my journey to sovereignty by exploring Bitcoin, FOSS tools and the cypherpunk movement.

In the attempt to learn more, I enumerate the facets of the Bitcoin and privacy rabbit holes. Both might seem technical and daunting, *at times, it is for me*, but I keep climbing.

This journey follows the open and supportive communities in the space. My goal is to take my mission higher by working with a Bitcoin-centric company.
