## In the next 3 months, my goal is to work with awesome people and help build Bitcoin and Sovereign centric tools to empower individuals.

While working in data analytics for numerous start-ups, I discovered Bitcoin and, like many people, it redesigned my life.

This place aims at crystallising what I learn on my journey to sovereignty by exploring Bitcoin, FOSS tools and tinkering with hardware and software.
