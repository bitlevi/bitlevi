### I will be part of a company with incredible individuals that build Bitcoin-centric tools in the next three months.

I worked in data analytics for various start-ups, where I managed projects and helped companies take decisions based on the data they collected. I strategised scalable data modelling solutions, data pipelines and dashboards. However, one aspect bothered me.

Data was an obsession in every company I worked with, and the amount collected left me speechless. **Modern tools track everything users do.**

Thankfully, I discovered Bitcoin, and it redesigned my life. 

Over the last year, I have focused my energy on Bitcoin and everything surrounding it. As I spend more time absorbed by the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I wish to leverage this energy towards building around this revolution. 

The open-source community has always been kind enough to answer my basic questions, and I wish to dedicate my energy to the creation of the new world on a Bitcoin standard whilst advocating for privacy.
