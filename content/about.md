### I will be part of a company with incredible individuals that build Bitcoin-centric and privacy-focused tools.

I bring extensive experience from data analytics, having steered projects for various startups. My expertise lies in crafting data-driven strategies, designing scalable models, pipelines, and dashboards that drive actionable insights.

Recently, I've channeled my passion into understanding Bitcoin's vast potential. With a deep appreciation for its revolutionary aspects, I'm eager to apply my skills in this domain.

Supported by the invaluable insights from the open-source community, I'm committed to innovating tools that champion freedom and privacy. I'm excited to bring this dedication to a team that values transformative tech and real-world impact.
