### In the next 3 months, my goal is to work with awesome people and help build Bitcoin and Sovereign centric tools to empower individuals.

After working in data analytics for various start ups, I discovered Bitcoin and it redesigned my life. Data was an obsession in every company I worked with and the amount of collected blew my mind.

Over the last year, my energy was focused on understanding Bitcoin and everything that surrounds it. As I spend more time being absorbed by the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I wish to leverage this energy towards building around Bitcoin.

Ideally, I want my values to be aligned with the people and companies I work with and that's where this blog comes into play.
